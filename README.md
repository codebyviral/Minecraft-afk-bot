Minecraft-afk-bot helps to penetrate an online bot inside your server.
This bot helps to experimentize usages of bots, intervals and other game usage.




## Features of Bot

- Respawn location of the bot can be changed
- Bot interaction can be done with custom lines of code
The bot automatically reconnects to the server after it has died in the game.
- This Bot can help make your server run 24x7 but with some in-game customizations


## Running this JS bot with aternos server :

Aternos server has recently made so many huge changes on the server. This AFK bot will
work for a few hours. After Aternos has detected it the TCP connection from Aternos server will be closed
so the bot cannot reconnect and cannot enter the game. Monitoring of this Bot from its Node.js app
will not help. This Bot is only made for experiments and learning concepts of the Node.js app.
